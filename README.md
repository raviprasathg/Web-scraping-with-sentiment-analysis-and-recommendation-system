# FlipKart Scrape (HAM)
### TIME is yout greatest ASSET. Let my bot(HAM) save some of it for you MY FRIEND!

##### We all cannot refuse the fact that while looking for products online, we often end up in a tough spot wherein  we have to decide which one among those products(elite) will be the best choice. We then have a hectic time going through some of the reviews for each of those products and then conclude. This often takes plenty of time. What if we have a bot(HAM) that goes through all of the reviews of the product of your choice and gives you a count of the number of positive and negative reviews, and also provides a recommendation value(-1 to 1) for each product. Yes, you have sensed it. This is exactly what my bot(HAM) does for you.

# INSTRUCTIONS
#### 1. Install python 3
#### 2. Install the required packages from requirements.txt file
#### 3. Create a file in your system whose content will hold the link of the product(homepage)
#### PS : Make sure to add the link of the new product in a new line in the file i.e, each and every link should be placed in a new line in the file 
#### 3. Open the folder "FlipKartScrape" in your favourite editor
#### 4. Run the main.py file. A GUI will pop up
#### 5. Click on the BROWSE button and select the file in which the links are stored

# POINTS TO NOTE:
#### -> When you start scraping there will be two directories created, namely "Files"(which is not necessary as a user) and "CSV Files"(the result will be here), in your current working directory.
#### -> "CSV Files" file will contain two CSV files. One of them will contain the result(sorted) and the other will not.
#### -> When you start scraping again, make sure to run the main.py file again and delete the contents of the two directories("Files" and "CSV Files")
